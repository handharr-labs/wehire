## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **Client onboarding wizard** at `/admin/onboarding` — 4-step guided setup for new `COMPANY_ADMIN` users ([#25](https://github.com/handharr-labs/wehire/issues/25))
  - Step 1: Company profile form (name, slug, logo, brand colors, contact email, WhatsApp)
  - Step 2: Google Drive setup checklist (manual folder/sheet creation guide)
  - Step 3: Connection verification via Apps Script ping (`GET ?action=getCompany&slug`)
  - Step 4: Launch — activates career page (`site_status → active`) and redirects to `/admin/jobs`
- `VerifyCompanyConnectionUseCase` — domain use case for Drive structure verification
- Server actions: `saveOnboardingProfileAction`, `verifyCompanyConnectionAction`, `launchCompanyAction`

### Changed
- Onboarding page skips wizard and redirects to `/admin/jobs` if company is already active
